Further discussion was discouraged when the elders ordered the minority who wished to share their technology on a mission across the wastes. The Brotherhood constructed airships and dispatched the minority East, to track down and assess the extent of the remaining super mutant threat. However, as they traveled over the great mountains a great storm broke the main airship and flung it far from its course. The mighty airship was badly damaged, the smaller sections were torn from the main craft and never to be seen again. Many of the expedition leaders, including Paladin Latham, were lost to the winds. The fraction of the crew that still survived, struggled to keep their ship aloft before finally crashing on the outskirts of the ruins of Chicago.

Adjacent to the oil installations, a government-funded military base was constructed, together with a satellite up-link station, as well as maintenance and repair facilities. Sometime after the destruction of the Oil Rig, Autumn Senior led the majority of Enclave forces east.[7] Some years after that, as part of the NCR-Enclave War, Navarro was assaulted by NCR forces in order to remove remnants of the Enclave from NCR territory. The NCR won the battle and the Enclave forces scattered[8]. Navarro was sacked, and the advanced technology left behind by the Enclave was recovered by the NCR, but it was too advanced in origin and makeup for them to understand. However, they noticed that the symbols found upon the technology (American flag, silo stencils, etc.) were identical to those that had been recovered at the Divide so a tie between the two was suspected. The NCR hired a Courier to take the item from Navarro to the Divide.","type":"building"}},{"type":"Point","coordinates":[24480,61577],"properties":{"name":"San Francisco","description":"San Francisco is a city in Northern California.

However, the corporation controlled every level of society in Irvine, enforcing its pristine perception with an iron fist. The robots, controlled by a super computer in the middle of the city, which was manufactured by the Irvine Land Corporation, were ostensibly the \"helpers\" that take care of the population's needs, but were in reality their overlords, controlling every aspect of their lives.[1] Outside the walls of Utopia, the ruins of a pre-War company called Interplay could be found.[1] This was a satirical take on the real-life Irvine Company, which developed the planned community of Irvine, wields considerable influence in that city and was Black Isle/Interplay's landlord at the time, and on the relatively squeaky-clean image of the real-life Irvine itself, which also has low crime and low poverty rates.","type":"town"}},{"type":"Point","coordinates":[28540,59943],"properties":{"name":"Maxson Bunker","description":"The Maxson bunker was a pre-War fallout shelter built by a senator for his family and himself.
